Problem 1: Given two sets of elements, find the sum of all distinct elements from the set.
 In other words, find the sum of all elements which are present in either of the given set.

Solution
-Define sum_of_distinct_elements(set1, set2):
-Create a new set to store distinct elements
    distinct_elements = set()
-Add all elements from set1 to the distinct_elements set
    for element in set1:
        distinct_elements.add(element)
-Add all elements from set2 to the distinct_elements set
    for element in set2:
        distinct_elements.add(element)
-Calculate the sum of distinct elements
    result = sum(distinct_elements)
set1 = [3, 1, 7, 9]
set2 = [2, 4, 1, 9, 3]
output = sum_of_distinct_elements(set1, set2)
Output = 26

-Initialize an empty set distinct_elements.

-Iterate through the elements of arr1 ( [3, 1, 7, 9] ):

-Add 3 to distinct_elements, which becomes {3}
-Add 1 to distinct_elements, which becomes {1, 3}
-Add 7 to distinct_elements, which becomes {1, 3, 7}
-Add 9 to distinct_elements, which becomes {1, 3, 7, 9}
-iterate through the elements of arr2 ( [2, 4, 1, 9, 3] ):

-Add 2 to distinct_elements, which becomes {1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 9} (2 is distinct)
-Add 4 to distinct_elements, which remains {1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 9} (4 is already in the set)
-Add 1 to distinct_elements, which remains {1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 9} (1 is already in the set)
-Add 9 to distinct_elements, which remains {1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 9} (9 is already in the set)
-Add 3 to distinct_elements, which remains {1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 9} (3 is already in the set)
Calculate the sum of elements in distinct_elements:

Sum = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 7 + 9 = 26
